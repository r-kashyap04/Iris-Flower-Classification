This project classifies Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using **Logistic Regression**. The classification is based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is explored and visualized, and the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris Dataset**, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target variable (`species`).

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Visualize the relationships between features using **pair plots**, **box plots**, and **correlation heatmaps**.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Train a **Logistic Regression** model using the features to predict the species.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using **classification metrics** such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and model building

## Results

The model successfully classifies Iris flowers into their respective species. **Setosa** is the most separable species, showing clear boundaries when compared to the others.
